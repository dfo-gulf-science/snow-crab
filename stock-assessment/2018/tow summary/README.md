## Sommaires des traits d'échantillonnages / Sampling trawl summaries:

These are individual plots for each valid sampling tow for the snow crab survey. Source of data are the vessel's GPS, the eSonar trawl acoustic sensors and various Minilog and Star Oddi depth-temperature probes at various locations on the trawl. Trawls can be identified by their tow date and tow number or by the unique tow identification number of the form GPXXX, where XXX refers is a number.

Each summary contains:
- a photo of the catch.
- the vessel's track and tow start and end points.
- the vessel's speed.
- the wingspread of the trawl.
- the depth profiles of the tow based on data from a Minilog probe attached to the trawl headline, two Star Oddi probes, one attached to the trawl headline and the other to the trawl footrope, from eSonar acoustic probes.
- the pitch, yaw and roll angles from a Star Oddi probe attched to the trawl footrope.
